# Twan Separation Kernel

A lightweight separation kernel designed specifically for adaptability, real-time computing, and mixed-criticality workloads.

## Overview

Twan is intended to serve as foundational infrastructure for building specialized systems rather than as a complete end-user environment. It is designed to be adapted and extended according to specific deployment requirements. It consists of two distinct components:

- **Twanvisor**: A hypervisor that leverages hardware assisted virtualisation to isolate partitions. Guests are paravirtualised and use API's provided by Twanvisor.
- **TwanRTOS**: Trusted root partition operating system that acts as the system orchestrator. It initializes Twanvisor, controls partition policies and serves as the central manager for hardware and system resources.

> **Note**: Twan is still in early stages of development.

## Support

Twan currently has support for Intel processors with: 

- **VT-x** 
- **EPTs** 
- **Unrestricted guest**

> **Note**: Even if your hardware fits these requirements, be aware that it may not work out of the box.

## Compliance

Twan is **not currently ARINC 653 or SKPP compliant** out of the box. Certification requires formal verification, safety analysis, and extensive validation beyond the current scope.
